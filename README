The following info is needed to configure the scripts and play the game. And since I tend to forget things, I'll try to write it down:

FLAGS
-----
protector
function: "protector"       //used to spawn a protector creep at the marked position
spawn: [spawn ID]           //ID of the spawn expected to construct the protector
volume #protectors      //number of protectors planned for this flag

narrowSource
function: "narrowSource"    //is used to mark energy sources for stationary harvesters. Without such flags, no stationary harvesters will spawn
spawn: [spawn ID]           //ID of the spawn in the narrow source's room

remoteController (1x / spawn)
function: "remoteController"    //used to reserve / claim uncontrolled room
spawn: [spawn ID]           //ID of the spawn expected to construct the claimer
claim: [1 / 0] // if 1 controller will be claimed if possible, otherwise only reserved

remoteSource (1x / spawn)
function: "remoteSource"    //used to harvest room from an uncontrolled room
spawn: [spawn ID]           //ID of the spawn expected to construct the remote harvester
volume: #harvesters      //number of harvesters planned for this resource
