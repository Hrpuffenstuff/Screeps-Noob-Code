The following info is needed to configure the scripts and play the game. And since I tend to forget things, I'll try to write it down:

FLAGS
-----
narrowSource
The function "narrowSource" is used to mark energy sources for stationary harvesters. Without such flags, no stationary harvesters will spawn.
The function "spawn" contains the ID of the spawner in the narrow source's room.

remoteController
